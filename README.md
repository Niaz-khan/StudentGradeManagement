# Student Grade Management System
## Overview

This Python script implements a simple student grade management system. It defines a Student class with attributes for student name and grades. The class includes methods to add grades, calculate the average grade, and determine the letter grade (to be implemented). The main function provides a user interface to interact with the system.

## Key Features:

Creates a Student object to store student information.
Allows users to add multiple grades for a student.
Calculates the average grade based on the added grades.
## How to Use:

Run the Python script.
Follow the on-screen prompts to add grades or calculate the average.
## Limitations:

Does not currently calculate letter grades.
Basic input validation.
Limited error handling.
## Future Improvements:

Implement letter grade calculation based on average grade.
Enhance input validation and error handling.
Add functionality to store student data persistently (e.g., using a database).
Allow for multiple students to be managed.
Implement a graphical user interface for better user experience.
